        <h5>1.Know Your Soil Type<br></h5>
        <p>Before you begin planting, dig up a scoop of soil and take a look at its texture. Is it dense and heavy and clump together when wet? Or is it loose and free flowing, like play sand? Maybe it’s somewhere in between, feeling somewhat sticky but crumbling easily, like a freshly baked cookie.

            All soils are a mixture of mineral particles — primarily clay, sand, and silt. Often they will contain higher amounts of one type of particle relative to the others. That doesn’t make them bad growing mediums, but it will affect their density, drainage rate, and capacity to hold nutrients.</p>
        <h5>2.Test the pH of Your Soil<br></h5>
        <p>The pH of your soil is one of the most important factors in determining its fertility. If your soil is too alkaline (with a pH above 7.5) or to acidic (with a pH below 5.5), that can make a big difference in which nutrients are available to your plants.

            Although most plants will tolerate a wide range of pH levels, they prefer slightly acidic soils (with a pH of 6 to 7) because important nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium dissolve readily in that environment. In soils that are too acidic or alkaline, your plants may get too much of some nutrients and not enough of others.
            
            </p>
            <h5>3.Amend with Organic Matter<br></h5>
            <p>Any type of soil can be improved by the addition of organic matter.

                Here are three common amendments:
                
                Composted yard waste
                Manure
                Fallen leaves
                In sandy soils, organic matter improves water-holding capacity and the retention of nutrients. In clay soils, it loosens up the minerals that become sticky when the soil is wet and hard when the soil is dry. And in all soils, it provides a rich supply of slow-release nutrients for your plants as well as food for beneficial soil organisms. Over time, a well-amended soil will provide most of the nutrients your plants need, reducing fertilizer requirements.</p>
            <h5>4.Enlist the Help of Microorganisms<br>
            </h5>
            <p>Dont simply think of soil as dirt. Think of it as microscopic world teeming with a vast array of organisms that breathe life into your garden. These organisms in your soil ecosystem — including earthworms, insects, fungi, and a multitude of beneficial bacteria — act as Mother Nature’s recycling crew, converting dead leaves and plant debris into readily available nutrients. They also help to aerate the soil and convert organic matter into humus.


                Know Your Soil History
                The history of your garden and how the soil has been treated — or mistreated — can also make a big difference in what it will take to improve it, says soil scientist Keith Reid, in his book Improving Your Soil. “Have you purchased a property in the country and want to create a garden in an old pasture? Do you want to improve a garden that you have cultivated for many years with lots of TLC? Or are you trying to start a garden in what passes for soil in a new subdivision? Know the history of your garden, make a note of what plants have been grown, what fertilizer or manure has been applied, and what did well or poorly. These details will help reveal the potential limitations of your soil.”
                
                “To enlist the help of microorganisms, create favorable conditions. As these are the same conditions that promote optimum plant growth, you’ll be doing your garden a double favor,” says Stell. To encourage soil life, she recommends keeping your soil evenly moist and well aerated and minimizing the use of pesticides. “Many of these are toxic to soil life as well as to whatever insects you’re trying to control,” she says. Also avoid the use of concentrated fast-acting fertilizers, which can harm earthworms and other soil organisms. Instead, use less-concentrated organic fertilizers and slow-release formulas.</p>
                <h5>5.Mulch with Care<br></h5>
                <p>
                    Mulching allows you to add organic matter to the soil without disturbing plant roots because you simply spread it over the surface and let it decompose naturally.

Mulch also helps to:<br>

*Retain moisture<br>
*Suppress weed growth<br>
*Keep the soil cooler during the summer<br>
*Improve soil aeration<br>
But mulch also has its pitfalls, especially if you use the wrong type of mulching material and apply it too thickly. It can change the chemical composition of the soil and leach micronutrients that are harmful to plants. It can also create continually moist conditions that lead to fungal diseases of plant roots, especially in wet soils and humid climates.

                <h5>6.Favor a No-Till Approach<br></h5>
                <p>Gardeners have widely varying opinions about the benefits of tilling. Many are convinced that turning over and breaking up the soil every year creates a favorable environment for their plants because it helps to mix in organic matter and improve drainage. Others say that tilling is a waste of time and may actually do more harm than good — and often they are right.

                    Tilling has a number of drawbacks. It can encourage the growth of weeds by bringing dormant seeds to the surface and exposing them to sunlight. It can disturb the beneficial burrowing activities of earthworms — the best free labor you can get for loosening and aerating your soil. It can also interfere with the activity of important soil microorganisms. Despite these negatives, tilling is still a viable option if you need to work organic matter and nutrients into sticky clay soil or a new garden bed that’s heavily compacted. After that initial deep tilling, you can often let nature take its course to improve the structure of your soil.
