        <h1>TYPES OF FERTILIZER</h1>
        <p>
            Its important to determine what your plants need in order to choose the right fertilizer. Pre-packaged fertilizers are formulated to meet different nutritional needs, with some specifically formulated for roses, trees and shrubs, vegetables, lawns, or bulbs to remove the guesswork.
            
            Organic vs. inorganic:
            Fertilizers are available as organic (plant or animal derived) or inorganic (man-made from chemicals). Organic types are better for the environment and help to improve overall soil health. Inorganic fertilizers do nothing to improve soil and have no positive residual effect. In some cases, they can be harmful to the environment and wildlife, so it’s important to weigh the pros and cons before using.
            
            Granular vs. water-soluble:
            There are two basic forms of fertilizers, each with advantages and drawbacks. Slow release granular fertilizers have the advantage of delivering nutrients over a longer period of time. Water-soluble fertilizers are faster acting, delivering a boost of nutrients when plants need a quick pick-me-up. These are generally less harsh and not as long-lasting, so need to be applied more frequently.
            
            Other popular fertilizer options include fertilizer spikes, liquid fertilizers, and compost teas.</p>

                "Feeding" vs "Fertilizing"
                Horticulturist and owner of Variegata Studio, Denise Kelly, says, "It’s helpful to remember that fertilizers are more akin to vitamins than food, especially when deciphering application rate and frequency. Plants make their own food through photosynthesis, harnessing the energy of the sun to create sugars from carbon dioxide and water. Plants also require mineral elements (similar to our vitamin supplements) for essential life processes; fertilizers provide one or more of these essential elements. Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium (N,P,K) are the three elements most likely to be deficient in our soils, as plants use them in greater amounts compared to other nutrients."
                
                The three primary nutrients (macronutrients) that all plants need are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K).
                
                Nitrogen promotes healthy leaf growth by stimulating the production of chlorophyll, which is the main pigment that allows plants to convert sunlight into food. Too much nitrogen will result in too much foliage and fewer flowers or fruit, while not enough nitrogen results in yellow leaves, stunted growth and smaller flowers or fruit.

                    ORGANIC AMENDMENTS
Besides prepackaged fertilizers, there are individual amendments and soil enhancers. Here are those most commonly used:

Compost is one of the most essential soil amendments, improving soil structure and providing a wide spectrum of nutrients and minerals. It can be homemade or bought commercially, and includes mushroom compost and worm castings. Compost promotes overall plant health, increasing resilience to pests and diseases. Work into the soil at planting time, or apply a 1-2 inch layer each spring around the base of established plants. It can also be steeped in water and used as a tea. Compost can rob plants of nitrogen if not completely broken down, so it may be necessary to supplement with a nitrogen source. Learn how to make your own compost at home.

Manure consists of waste from livestock animals including cows, horses, chickens, steers, or rabbits. One of the best overall fertilizers, manure is packed with nitrogen and other nutrients, as well as trace minerals. It is both a fertilizer and amendment, improving soil structure and promoting lush growth. Make sure manure is well-aged so it doesn’t burn plants. Work into the soil at the time of planting or mulch established plants with a one-inch layer in spring. Manure can also be steeped in water and used as a tea.
